## Getting Started

Welcome to the Marketplace. It is a Java software to manage and buy items (with particular attention for food and computers) from different stores. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccritne/Marketplace.git
cd Marketplace
javac -d bin src/*.java
java -cp bin App

```

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
